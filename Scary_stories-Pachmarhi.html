      <p>"One of my friends and I were exploring Pachmarhi after attending the wedding of a school friend. We had
        explored Pandava Caves, visited Pachmarhi Lake and were now visiting a nearby waterfall when the thought of
        exploring the forest struck us.</p>

      <p>We had barely walked 50 metres away from the waterfall when we came across a little girl, around 11-12 years
        old. She said she had come with her mother to see the falls and now couldn't find her. Her clothes were soiled
        and too old for someone who was here just for a picnic. We told her to stay there while we looked for her
        mother. After searching for a few minutes, we decided to split and search in different directions.</p>

      <p>We spent over an hour searching for her mother but in vain. It was getting dark and we thought of getting out
        of there and taking the kid with us to the nearest police station to report the matter. We found her exactly
        where we met her an hour ago. When we asked her to come along with us, she said, "You can come here tomorrow.
        We'll try to find her again. See you tomorrow."</strong></p>
