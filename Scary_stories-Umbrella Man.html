    <div class="story-content">
      <p>"It was a holiday in school and a friend and I had planned to chill at the Mall Road and have some snacks.
        However, by the time we reached Mall Road, it was already 7 pm. We had coffee, enjoyed clicking pictures and had
        amazing momos at a restaurant on The Ridge. At 9 pm, we started walking back to our respective homes. I had
        barely walked a few hundred metres when it started drizzling. I was at a section of a road which was very quiet
        and had no shops but some of the streetlights were still on.</p>

      <p>As I walked further, I saw a man with an umbrella walking a few feet ahead of me. I thought it would be a good
        idea to ask if he would allow me to join him if he was going the same way. I walked faster but it seemed that I
        wasn't fast enough. So I started jogging but I still couldn't catch up with him. <em>"Hello!"</em> I shouted
        loudly and the man turned around. His age must have been somewhere in the late 60s but what surprised me was the
        fact that despite having an umbrella, he was completely drenched. He started walking again and this time I
        walked slowly. Perhaps, I didn't want to be near him anymore.</p>

      <p>He slowed down too. I walked even more slowly and so did he. Finally, I stopped. There was complete silence. He
        had also stopped. I could feel the fear suffocating my thoughts. Just when I thought that I may not live long
        enough to share this experience, I heard a siren blaring and a police vehicle stopped behind me. They asked me
        what I was doing here alone. When I told them this story, they said I was alone. There was no one there with an
        umbrella and that I should stop sleepwalking." <strong>- Arpit Tanta, student, Shimla</strong></p>
