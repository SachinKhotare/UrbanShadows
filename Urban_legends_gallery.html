            <p class="legend-text">
              Once upon a time, there was a well-off village near Jaisalmer. One night, it just vanished.

              The village of Kuldhara had 84 villages and within a night, it ceased to exist. People say that villagers
              left their homes but no one saw them leaving. How? Why? Where? These questions remain unanswered.

              According to an urban legend India, a minister wanted to marry the daughter of the village chief. When
              rejected, the minister warned them to give him the girl within 24 hours or they will face consequences.

              The entire village thought of leaving rather than to give in to his cruel intent. But before they
              took-off, they put a curse of death on Kuldhara village. After that day, anybody that tried to live here
              faced death.

              Will you take the risk to live here?

            <p class="legend-text">
              A 14th-century hunting lodge, Malcha Mahal was built by the Sultan of Delhi ‚Äì Feroz Shah Tughlaq. Later in
              the 19th-century, the rulers of Oudh, Uttar Pradesh took over the mahal in New Delhi.

              Britishers took over in 1856 and the Mahal‚Äôs king, Wajid Ali Shah was sent to Kolkata. After years,
              Wajid‚Äôs angry daughter announced a legal battle with the Indian government.

              And when she finally got custody of Malcha Mahal, she moved in with her two children. No one to this date
              knows why she committed suicide several years later and left her children with the treasure and property.

              Legend has it that the descendants of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah isolated themselves and continued to live here.
              People have often been gunned down and have bounds set on them. The guards of the nearby Earth Centre
              claimed to see journalists sneaking in Malcha Mahal and never returning.

            <h5 class="card-title">Bhangarh Fort</h5>
            <p class="legend-text">
              All the Delhi people may or may have not known about this. Ghost enthusiasts are intrigued to visit this
              fort situated on the outskirts of Delhi.

              It was built by Raja Bhagwant Singh in 1573 AD and is among the most haunted places in India. Moreover,
              the Archeological Survey of India has forbidden access to the fort after sunset and asked the locals to
              move outside the limits of the Bhangarh fort.

              There are two legends of this place. The first one mentions the city of Bhangarh to have been cursed by a
              religious man called Baba Balak Nath. He permitted the fort‚Äôs construction but made a condition to not
              cast a shadow over his home.

              He also warned that if this happened, he would ruin the city. What do you think happened? The fort formed
              a shadow over his house and he cursed the town along with the Bhangarh fort. People also say that his body
              is still buried there.

              The second legend is about a wizard named Singiya. He was head over heels in love with the Princess of
              Bhangarh, Ratnavati.

              So, to win her over, he put a spell on a fragrance and asked her maid to give her. The Princess was aware
              of this and his plan spoiled. Enraged, the wizard cursed the city. Many people believe that his ghosts
              still haunt the place.

              People also say that Princess Ratnavati reincarnated in a new body and Bhangarh Fort is still waiting for
              her to put an end to this curse.

              Would you dare to go?

            <h5 class="card-title">Bullet Baba</h5>
            <p class="legend-text">
              One of the recent urban legend India of Jodhpur features the 350 cc Royal Enfield deity, ‚ÄúBullet Baba‚Äù.

              According to legend, Om Banna died some 20 years ago while driving his bullet and was passing through
              Jodhpur. The police came and took the bullet to the police station. It is surprising to know that it keeps
              on disappearing from the station only to be found at a new place each time.

              The news spread like a forest fire and this bike is now placed inside a temple. People offer a ‚ÄúBullet‚Äù
              brand beer to keep his ghost satisfied.

              So, next time you pass through Pali-Jodhpur highway, don‚Äôt honk and make sure to worship him, or else you
              won‚Äôt make it to your destination alive.

            <p class="legend-text">
              Another mind-boggling urban legend comes from northeast India. Many years ago, it was all over the news
              that disturbed a lot of people.

              Bird Suicides! Yes, Jatinga is known for its crazy urban legend of the supernatural angle of bird
              suicides. Every year from September to November, birds randomly come flying to this specific location and
              drop dead on the ground. Weird right?

              For so many years, people believed that this was some other-worldly phenomenon that intrigued a lot of
              researchers from around the world.

              Studies suggest that birds get lost when they enter a fog and try to travel to any source of light. They
              accidentally hit the street lights and walls that lead to their death.

              Locals have also stated to hit the disoriented birds as they make for easy prey. Whatever the theories
              are, Jatinga remains a mystery to inquisitive explorers.

              ‚ÄòNoh‚Äô that means to jump truly is what this urban legend of India is based on. It is about a woman jumping
              off the tallest plunge waterfall in India ‚Äì Nohkalikai falls. Why did she do that? Let‚Äôs find out.

              According to legend, a widow named Ka Likai lived with his infant in Meghalaya. She remarried but gave
              undivided attention to her child.

              The husband got jealous, killed the infant, and cooked him. After work, the mother sat for a hearty meal
              cooked by her husband and found a tiny human finger in her food. Can you guess what happened after?

              She screamed on top of her lungs, grieved, and cried. Ka Likai ran out of the house like a mad person and
              jumped off the Nohkalikai waterfall.

              So cruel, right?

              Situated in the suburbs of Goregaon, Aarey Colony is known for chasing ghost stories. Serving as a picnic
              spot in the daytime, this colony becomes a hub for ghosts at night.

              Many filmmakers shoot at this very location that had frightened the crew members in the past. Also, people
              say they have seen a woman lurking around late at night. The guards of the Aarey Colony also claim to have
              heard and seen a lady ghost that chases and stops the people driving around.

              And, if you will not stop, she will scare the hell out of you!

            <p class="legend-text">
              DO NOT take other people‚Äôs credit! Yes, this urban legend of India is based on credit theft only.

              So, this story comes from the Wayanad district of Kerala, particularly from Thamarassery Ghat Pass. It is
              believed to be haunted by a local tribesman called Karinthandan.

              Legend says that a British once took help from this tribesman and that‚Äôs when this tale began. He wanted
              to find the shortest route to cross over the Thamarassery pass to gain access to the treasure trove of
              Wayanad. So, the tribesman, being a nice person, helped him.

              What did the Britisher give him in return? Thank you? We wish! He brutally murdered him and took all the
              credit for finding this route.

              After a while, travelers passing through the Lakkidi Gateway reported seeing the wandering ghost of
              Karinthandan.

              A priest was also called to chain his ghost to a tree. Surprisingly, this chain has grown with the tree,
              which people think to be the spirit of Karinthandan that has not been freed till now.

              Do you have the audacity to take other people‚Äôs credit now?

              As the name suggests, this is the legend of the mystical Seven Pagodas. And they have an undefined
              mystery.

              Mahabalipuram‚Äôs legend states that during the eighth century, the Shore Temple ‚Äì a UNESCO World Heritage
              Site was accompanied by six other temples.

              These pagodas were so breathtaking that even gods couldn‚Äôt resist admiring their beauty. They got
              ‚Äújealous‚Äù! Can you believe it? The Pagodas must be hella gorgeous!

              However, Lord Indra instigated a storm that engulfed the whole city underwater except for one, the Shore
              Temple. During the tsunami of December 2004, century-old residues were seen on the ocean floor and were
              speculated to be the remains of these mysterious pagodas.

              According to legend, the spirit of Lady Morgan still lives in this house. After all, we cannot be mad at
