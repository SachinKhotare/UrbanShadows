      <p>"I had heard many horror stories surrounding the Dumas Beach in Surat. I am not a daredevil but I am an
        adventurer who loves to travel. So, there I was, at the Dumas Beach on Christmas eve last year. It was around 7
        pm and I was enjoying long-exposure photography when I suddenly heard someone screaming. I had noticed a few
        children playing in the water a while ago but most of them had left. I waded into the water to see if anyone was
        in trouble.</p>

      <p>I could hear a child crying. I had waded in deep enough to start swimming. Suddenly, I felt a strong push by a
        pair of hands on my back and I plunged into the water. Even though I knew swimming, an unlikely fear of drowning
        overpowered me. Perhaps, I was in shock with everything that had happened in the last minute. I managed to swim
        back to the beach only to realise how far into the sea I had wandered in from there. It was hard to believe how
        it could happen. Moreover, the cries had died down.</p>

      <p>I don't know whether it was real or something beyond the realms of what I could see but I was convinced I
        hadn't waded so far into the sea that I had to swim for a good minute to get back to the beach." </p>
