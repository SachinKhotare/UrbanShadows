      <p>"I had just arrived at Dharchula from Panchachuli and was going to stay at a guest house in Dharchula for the
        night. Surprisingly, the guest house I was staying in had no other guest. I had my dinner and went off to sleep
        at around 10:30 pm.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, I could feel the bed shaking and started escalating, seconds later. I jumped out of bed, ready to put
        on my slippers and run out as I was sure it was an earthquake. But utter darkness surrounded me and the shaking
        stopped. It was completely silent. I turned the lights on and walked out of the door. It was raining and
        completely dark. No one was awake. I rushed down the stairs towards the reception area to ask the men there
        about the earthquake.</p>

      <p>Two of them were awake and were watching a cricket match. "Nothing shook here. We didn't feel any earthquake"
        they said when I asked them. I was sure the bed was shaking. What kind of earthquake was that? Or was it even an
        earthquake? Well, I couldn't sleep after that and ended up watching TV the whole night." </p>
